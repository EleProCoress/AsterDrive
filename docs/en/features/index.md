# Feature Map

This section is organized by backend capability, not by user task.

If you are a regular user, start with the [User Manual](/en/guide/user-guide) and [Common Workflows](/en/guide/core-workflows). If you manage an instance, troubleshoot behavior, or build on top of AsterDrive, the feature map helps locate which capability owns which boundary and which documentation page to read next.
