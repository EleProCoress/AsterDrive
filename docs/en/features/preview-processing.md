# Preview and Processing

Preview and processing turn original files into browser-viewable, openable, or streamable results. This area does not change file ownership, but it depends on storage reads, background tasks, external tools, and WOPI services.

## Capability Boundaries

| Capability | Notes | Related docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thumbnails | Thumbnail generation, cache, and background tasks for supported MIME types | [System Settings](/en/config/runtime), [User Manual](/en/guide/user-guide) |
| Media metadata | Audio/video metadata from local tools or storage-native processing | [Tencent COS](/en/storage/tencent-cos) |
| Archive preview | Read-only directory listing and file reading inside archives; disabled by default | [Online Preview and WOPI](/en/guide/preview-and-wopi), [System Settings](/en/config/runtime) |
| WOPI | OnlyOffice / Collabora open and save flows | [Online Preview and WOPI](/en/guide/preview-and-wopi), [File Editing](/en/guide/editing) |
| Browser editing | Text-like file editing, saves, version records | [File Editing](/en/guide/editing) |
| Share streaming | Short-lived audio/video playback session on share pages | [Sharing and Public Access](/en/guide/sharing), [System Settings](/en/config/runtime) |

## Backend Modules

| Module | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `thumbnail_service`, `task_service::thumbnail` | Thumbnail cache and task dispatch |
| `media_processing_service` | VIPS / FFmpeg / FFprobe processor resolution |
| `media_metadata_service` | Audio/video metadata parsing |
| `archive_service`, `archive_preview_service` | Archive scanning, path validation, read-only preview |
| `preview_app_service`, `wopi_service` | Preview apps, WOPI discovery, locks, proof, sessions |
| `stream_ticket_service`, `share_stream_service` | Share streaming tickets and short sessions |

## Configuration Entry Points

| Entry point | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Admin -> System Settings -> File Processing` | Thumbnails, media processors, archive preview |
| `Admin -> System Settings -> Site Configuration -> Preview Apps` | WOPI discovery and open methods |
| `Admin -> System Settings -> Runtime` | Share streaming session TTL and runtime limits |
| Storage policy editor | Storage-native processing switches such as Tencent COS |

## Troubleshooting Direction

- WOPI does not open: confirm public site URL, WOPI callback reachability, and enabled file extensions.
- Thumbnails do not generate: check MIME support, failed background tasks, and processor availability.
- Archive preview fails: check global switch, file size, supported format, and archive path safety.
- Share-page media playback stops: check share streaming session TTL and reverse proxy streaming behavior.
