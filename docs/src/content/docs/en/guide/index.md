description: Overview of the AsterDrive user guide, organized by getting started, daily use, admin configuration, operations, and reference content.
title: "User Guide"
---

This documentation set is organized by what you are trying to do, not by feature names you have to memorize.

If this is your first time here, start with [Getting Started](./getting-started/). If your service is already running, jump directly to the section that matches your role.

## First Deployment

If you just want to get the service running first, read these pages:

- [Getting Started](./getting-started/): run through login, upload, sharing, and WebDAV with the fewest steps
- [Deployment Overview](/en/deployment/): choose Docker, systemd, or a direct binary run before going live
- [First-Start Checklist](/en/deployment/runtime-behavior/): confirm default configuration, storage policies, health checks, and background tasks
- [Reverse Proxy](/en/deployment/reverse-proxy/): read this before adding HTTPS, a domain name, WebDAV, or WOPI

## Daily Use

After the service opens normally, regular users should start here:

- [User Manual](./user-guide/): files, workspaces, trash, shares, WebDAV, and personal settings
- [Common Workflows](./core-workflows/): common operations connected through real scenarios
- [Teams and Permissions](./teams-and-permissions/): personal spaces, team spaces, team roles, and admin boundaries
- [Sharing and Public Access](./sharing/): share links, passwords, expiration, and download limits
- [File Editing](./editing/): in-browser editing, version history, and WOPI open methods
- [Online Preview and WOPI](./preview-and-wopi/): OnlyOffice, Collabora, and WOPI open-method integration
- [Uploads and Large Files](./upload-modes/): resumable uploads, direct-to-object-storage uploads, and failure diagnosis

## Feature Map

If you are not looking by task, but by backend capability and ownership boundary, read the [Feature Map](/en/features/).

It connects identity and access, files and workspaces, uploads and storage, preview and processing, and system operations. It is useful for administrators, troubleshooting, and extension work.

## Administrators

Administrators should separate three entry points first: the admin UI, runtime system settings, and the startup configuration file.

- [Admin Console](./admin-console/): what each admin page is responsible for
- [Configuration Overview](/en/config/): what `config.toml`, system settings, storage policies, and external proxies each control
- [System Settings](/en/config/runtime/): site, registration, cookies, mail, scheduling, trash, WOPI, and audit logs
- [External Authentication](/en/config/external-auth/): connect OpenID Connect, Generic OAuth2, Logto, GitHub, QQ, Google, or Microsoft login
- [Storage Policies](/en/config/storage/): storage types, policy groups, and existing data migration
- [Storage Backend Details](/en/storage/): backend-specific tutorials and options
- [Follower Nodes](./remote-nodes/): connect another AsterDrive instance as a remote storage backend
- [Custom Frontend](./custom-frontend/): replace frontend assets, inject custom configuration, and handle CSP

## Operations

After launch, stable operation matters more than whether the page can open. Prepare your checks, backup, upgrade, and troubleshooting paths ahead of time.

- [Operations CLI](/en/deployment/ops-cli/): `doctor`, offline system settings, cross-database migration, and node enrollment
- [Production Checklist](/en/deployment/production-checklist/): final HTTPS, data, backup, storage, and real-feature checks before launch
- [Upgrades and Version Migration](/en/deployment/upgrade/): backup before upgrading, verify after upgrading, and roll back after failures
- [Backup and Restore](/en/deployment/backup/): database, configuration, local upload directory, and restore order
- [Troubleshooting](/en/deployment/troubleshooting/): startup, upload, download, sharing, WebDAV, WOPI, and background tasks
- [Performance Benchmarking](/en/deployment/performance-benchmarking/): establish a local baseline and rerun smoke tests

## The Project Itself

To understand why AsterDrive is designed this way, who it is for, and who it is not for, read [About AsterDrive](/en/reference/about/).

To build the system mental model first, read [Architecture Overview](/en/reference/architecture/). It covers primary / follower nodes, component relationships, upload and download data flows, and troubleshooting entry points.

If a concept is unclear, start with the [Glossary](/en/reference/glossary/). When you hit a problem, check the [FAQ Triage](/en/reference/faq/) first. If you have an error code, read [Error Code Handling](/en/reference/errors/). If the problem happens during deployment, reverse proxying, WebDAV, or WOPI, use it together with [Troubleshooting](/en/deployment/troubleshooting/).
