title: "WebDAV"
---

:::tip[This page has two layers]

- **`[webdav]` in `config.toml`** - Path prefix and hard upload size limit. **Requires a restart after changes.**
- **`Admin -> System Settings -> WebDAV`** - The global switch and system-file blocking rules. Saved changes affect new requests immediately without a restart.

Regular WebDAV users usually only need to create a dedicated account in the workspace they want to connect, then enter the address in Finder, Windows, or rclone. Personal and team spaces use the same WebDAV address; credentials decide which workspace the client enters.
:::

## Static Configuration in `config.toml`

```toml
[webdav]
prefix = "/webdav"
payload_limit = 10737418240
xml_payload_limit = 1048576
```

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prefix` | `"/webdav"` | WebDAV path prefix. Client addresses must change with it. |
| `payload_limit` | `10737418240` | Hard WebDAV file write body limit. Default is 10 GiB. |
| `xml_payload_limit` | `1048576` | Hard XML request body limit. Default is 1 MiB; used by `PROPFIND`, `PROPPATCH`, `REPORT`, and `LOCK`. |

:::caution[Restart the service after changing these static options]
Unlike the runtime global switch, static configuration is read only once during startup.

## Runtime Settings in the Admin Console

Entry point:

```text
Admin -> System Settings -> WebDAV
```

There are three settings:

- **Enable WebDAV**: the global switch. After it is disabled, desktop clients can no longer access files. **No restart is required.**
- **Block WebDAV System Files**: enabled by default. Blocks operating-system metadata files automatically created by Finder, Windows Explorer, and sync tools.
- **Blocked WebDAV System-File Patterns**: matches file or directory basenames, ignores case, and supports simple `*` wildcards.

The default blocked names are:

- `.DS_Store`
- `._*`
- `.Spotlight-V100`
- `.Trashes`
- `.fseventsd`
- `Thumbs.db`
- `desktop.ini`
- `$RECYCLE.BIN`
- `System Volume Information`

These files are usually not content users intentionally want to keep. When blocking is enabled, clients receive `403` if they try to create them through WebDAV. Normal file uploads are unaffected.

:::tip[When to change the rules]
Most sites should keep the defaults. Change them only if you explicitly want to back up these system metadata files, or if a client repeatedly fails because of a blocked pattern and that affects normal sync behavior.
:::

## Standard Usage for Regular Users

1. Open `WebDAV` in the workspace you want to connect, and create a dedicated account
2. Set a username and password
3. Optionally restrict it to a folder under the root directory
4. Enter the address, username, and password in Finder, Windows Explorer, rclone, or Mountain Duck

:::tip[Use a dedicated account. Do not reuse the web login password.]
A WebDAV dedicated account has independently managed password and scope. Losing it will not affect the main account.
:::

Personal-space WebDAV accounts access only personal files. Team-space WebDAV accounts are created from the team workspace or `Settings -> Teams -> Team Details -> WebDAV` and access only the matching team files. Team owners and administrators can manage all team accounts; regular members can manage only their own team WebDAV accounts.

## Default Address

```text
https://your-domain/webdav/
```

The `/webdav/` mount root exists only as an entry point and listing boundary; it is not a real folder row in the database. Clients may use `PROPFIND` on it to list the root directory, but `PROPPATCH /webdav/` cannot write custom dead properties and explicitly returns `403 Forbidden`. Custom properties must target a concrete file or folder.

If you change `prefix` to `/dav`, change the client address too:

```text
https://your-domain/dav/
```

## Large Uploads Depend on Three Limits

When uploading large files through WebDAV, these three limits apply, and **the smallest one wins**:

1. `webdav.payload_limit`
2. Reverse proxy upload size limit, such as Nginx `client_max_body_size` or Caddy equivalents
3. Single-file size limit in the storage policy

If any one of them blocks the upload, the whole upload is blocked. Check all three while troubleshooting.

`xml_payload_limit` does not limit file content uploads. It only limits XML control requests. Most deployments do not need to adjust it unless a client sends unusually large directory queries, lock requests, or property updates.

## Locks and Concurrent Writes

AsterDrive supports common WebDAV `LOCK` / `UNLOCK` flows, including exclusive and shared locks. When a lock exists, clients must send the correct `Lock-Token` or `If` condition to continue writing. Otherwise operations that may break consistency, such as overwrite, move, copy, and delete, are rejected.

Important details:

- The same resource may have multiple shared locks when the protocol allows it
- Recursive folder move, copy, and delete operations check conflict locks in the source and target trees
- Expired locks are cleaned by background jobs; locks left behind by crashed clients can also be cleaned under `Admin -> Locks`

If a desktop client reports locked, conflict, or precondition failed, first check whether the same file is still open in another client or online editor. After confirming nobody else is using it, wait for the lock to expire or ask an administrator to clean the abnormal lock under `Admin -> Locks`.

## Do Not Drop These When Using a Reverse Proxy

:::caution[WebDAV is not only GET/PUT]
WebDAV uses a set of extension methods and headers that reverse proxies often drop by default. Make sure the proxy layer forwards:

**Headers:** `Authorization`, `Depth`, `Destination`, `Overwrite`, `If`, `Lock-Token`, `Timeout`

**Methods:** `PROPFIND`, `PROPPATCH`, `MKCOL`, `MOVE`, `COPY`, `LOCK`, `UNLOCK`
