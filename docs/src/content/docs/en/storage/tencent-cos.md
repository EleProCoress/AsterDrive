title: "Tencent COS Storage Policy Tutorial"
---

:::tip[What this page covers]
This page walks through the complete flow for writing AsterDrive files to Tencent COS: prepare a bucket, create a `tencent_cos` storage policy, configure policy group rules, bind users or teams, verify uploads and downloads, and understand the switches, suffixes, and billing boundaries for COS CI native processing.
:::

## When to Use It

Tencent COS is suitable when:

- You already use Tencent COS and want AsterDrive to write directly into a COS bucket
- You have many or large files and want object storage to carry capacity and bandwidth
- You want to enable Tencent-native COS CI features per storage policy, such as image thumbnails or media-info parsing
- You want the frontend and admin console to clearly show "Tencent COS" instead of hiding it under a generic S3-compatible backend

If you only need generic S3-compatible object storage and do not need Tencent COS CI features, use the [S3 / MinIO / R2 storage policy tutorial](/en/storage/s3-minio-r2/) instead.

## Choosing Between COS and Generic S3 Storage

Tencent COS supports standard object-storage operations and also provides Tencent-specific features such as COS CI. AsterDrive therefore shows it as a separate storage type.

Choose **Tencent COS** when you need Tencent features such as image thumbnails or media information. If you only need generic object storage, also see the [S3 / MinIO / R2 storage policy tutorial](/en/storage/s3-minio-r2/).

## First, Separate the Layers

```mermaid

  Cos["Tencent COS"] --> Bucket["Bucket / credentials / CORS / COS CI"]
  Bucket --> Policy["AsterDrive Tencent COS storage policy"]
  Policy --> Rule["Policy group rule"]
  Rule --> Binding["User or team bound to the policy group"]
```

Creating only a COS storage policy is not enough. When users or teams upload files, they first match a policy group, and then a policy group rule assigns the upload to a storage policy.

## Entries Used in This Page

| What you want to do | Entry |
| --- | --- |
| Create a COS policy | `Admin -> Storage Policies -> New Policy` |
| Test the COS connection | `Admin -> Storage Policies -> Test Connection` |
| Create routing rules | `Admin -> Policy Groups` |
| Bind a policy group to a user | `Admin -> Users -> User Details` |
| Bind a policy group to a team | `Admin -> Teams -> Team Details` |
| Configure global media processing | `Admin -> System Settings -> File Processing` |

## 1. Prepare the Bucket and Prefix

Create a dedicated bucket in the Tencent COS console, for example:

```text
asterdrive-prod-1250000000
```

It is recommended to allocate a dedicated prefix for AsterDrive:

```text
prod/
```

Objects are then expanded under that prefix using AsterDrive's content-addressed paths. Do not let multiple AsterDrive instances write to the same prefix unless you clearly know they will not overwrite each other or clean up each other's objects.

:::caution[Do not manually move objects in the bucket]
The AsterDrive database records object paths. Manually moving, renaming, or deleting objects in COS will make database file records inconsistent with the real objects.
:::

## 2. Prepare Access Credentials

Prepare a Tencent Cloud credential pair for AsterDrive that is used only for this bucket / prefix.

At minimum, it needs to cover:

- Reading objects
- Writing objects
- Deleting objects
- Operations required for large-file uploads
- Necessary access to the target bucket / prefix

If you enable COS CI, also confirm that the credential can make the corresponding CI processing requests, such as image processing or media-info parsing. Permission names and console entries may change with Tencent Cloud product updates; follow Tencent Cloud's latest documentation and console hints.

## 3. Choose Upload and Download Modes First

For the first integration, use the conservative path:

| Direction | Recommended initial value | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upload mode | `relay_stream` | The browser does not need to connect directly to COS, so there are fewer CORS issues |
| Download mode | `relay_stream` | Downloads are also relayed by AsterDrive first, which makes troubleshooting easier |

After confirming basic reads and writes work, then consider switching to:

- Upload `presigned`
- Download `presigned`

:::caution[LightCOS requires server relay]
If you use a **[Light Cloud Object Storage (LightCOS)](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1722/112004)** bucket, keep both upload and download modes set to `relay_stream`. LightCOS does not provide bucket-level CORS configuration, so browser `presigned` upload and direct download are not suitable.
:::

### How `relay_stream` Works

During upload:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Browser["Browser"] --> AsterDrive["AsterDrive"] --> Cos["COS"]
```

During download:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Cos["COS"] --> AsterDrive["AsterDrive"] --> Browser["Browser"]
```

The advantage is a single entry point and simpler troubleshooting. The trade-off is that the application node must carry upload and download bandwidth.

### How `presigned` Works

During upload:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Browser["Browser"] --> Cos["COS"]
```

During download:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Browser["Browser"] --> PresignedUrl["Short-lived COS URL"]
```

The advantage is reduced bandwidth pressure on the AsterDrive node. The prerequisite is that browsers can access the COS endpoint and COS CORS is configured correctly.

## 4. Configure COS CORS

If you only use `relay_stream`, browsers do not directly request COS, so CORS is not the first priority.

If you use `presigned` upload, the COS bucket must allow browser cross-origin uploads. At minimum, check:

- `AllowedOrigin`: your public AsterDrive site URL
- `AllowedMethod`: includes `PUT`
- `AllowedHeader`: allows the headers used by upload requests
- `ExposeHeader`: includes `ETag`

If you use `presigned` download, also confirm that browsers can access the returned COS download URL and that you accept response headers and cache behavior being controlled more by COS.

### Configure CORS Through AsterDrive

AsterDrive can execute a storage action for a Tencent COS policy from the admin console:

```text
Admin -> Storage Policies -> target COS policy -> Configure CORS
```

This feature applies to standard Tencent COS buckets, not LightCOS.

Before running the action, enter the public site addresses that users actually use to open AsterDrive:

```text
Admin -> System Settings -> Site -> Public Site URL
```

Each address must be a complete HTTP(S) origin such as `https://drive.example.com`. Do not include paths, query strings, or wildcards.

AsterDrive creates or updates its own COS CORS rule from these addresses and preserves unrelated rules. Do not edit CORS for the same bucket in the Tencent Cloud console at the same time, because concurrent changes may overwrite each other.

The Tencent Cloud credential used by the policy needs permission to read and update bucket CORS. If the action fails, first check the public site address, Access Key / Secret Key, bucket region, and CORS permissions.

## 5. Create a Tencent COS Storage Policy in AsterDrive

Open:

```text
Admin -> Storage Policies -> New Policy
```

Choose the driver type:

```text
Tencent COS
```

Common fields:

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint | `https://asterdrive-prod-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com` |
| Bucket | `asterdrive-prod-1250000000` |
| Access Key | Tencent Cloud secret ID |
| Secret Key | Tencent Cloud secret key |
| Prefix / base path | `prod/` |
| Upload mode | Use `relay_stream` for the first setup |
| Download mode | Use `relay_stream` for the first setup |

Use the COS endpoint shown in the Tencent Cloud console. You do not need to tune it as a generic S3 path-style service.

Before or after saving, click `Test Connection` once. When editing an existing policy, leaving Access Key or Secret Key blank lets the draft connection test reuse the credentials already saved for that policy. This lets you test endpoint, bucket, base path, upload mode, or COS CI switch changes without pasting the secret every time. New policies have no saved credentials to reuse, so required credentials still need to be filled in.

When a connection test fails, the admin console shows a useful reason while hiding the Secret Key and other sensitive values.

## 6. Test the Connection Before Saving

Before or after saving, use the admin-console connection test to confirm:

- The AsterDrive server can access the COS endpoint
- The bucket name is correct
- The credentials can read and write the target prefix
- The bucket region and endpoint match
- The server time is accurate

If the connection test fails, do not move users to this policy. Check in this order first:

1. Whether the endpoint is accessible from the AsterDrive server
2. Whether the HTTPS certificate is trusted
3. Whether the bucket name is correct
4. Whether the Access Key / Secret Key is correct
5. Whether credential permissions cover the target bucket / prefix
6. Whether the AsterDrive server time is accurate
7. Whether the bucket has the required COS / CI features enabled

## 7. Configure Storage-Native Processing

:::caution[Confirm billing before enabling this]
Storage-native processing calls Tencent COS CI. AsterDrive caches generated thumbnails, media information, and similar results so they are not processed on every view, but the first generation and provider-side processing requests can still incur charges.
:::

The entry is the **Storage-native processing** section in the COS storage policy editor.

### Master Switch

`Enable storage-native processing` is the master switch for the current policy. When disabled, this policy will not call COS CI features.

### Native Thumbnails

Native thumbnails require all of these conditions:

- `Enable storage-native processing` is enabled
- Thumbnail processor is `storage_native`
- `Native thumbnail extensions` matches the current file name

Suffixes are per-policy. For example:

```text
jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif
```

Files that do not match continue through the global media processors.

### Native Media Info

Native media-info parsing requires all of these conditions:

- `Enable storage-native processing` is enabled
- `Enable native media info` is enabled
- `Native media info extensions` matches the current file name

The suffix list is empty by default. Even if `Enable native media info` is on, an empty list will not call COS CI.

Add only audio/video suffixes you intentionally want COS to parse on each COS policy, for example:

```text
mp4, mov, m4v, mkv, webm, mp3, m4a, flac, wav
```

Do not blindly add every possible suffix. AsterDrive caches media information, but the first parsing request still calls COS CI.

### Document Preview

AsterDrive currently does not provide COS document HTML preview. Tencent Cloud's current public pricing pages do not list a free quota for this feature, so check costs carefully before using similar processing features.

## 8. Free Quotas and Billing Boundaries

References last checked: 2026-06-02. Always confirm against Tencent Cloud's latest pages before enabling billing-sensitive features.

Under Tencent Cloud's current public pricing pages:

| Capability | Free-quota wording | AsterDrive-side note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic image processing | 10 TB monthly free quota | Native image thumbnails use this; usage outside the free-quota rules is billed by Tencent Cloud |
| Video media-info retrieval | 6000 requests / 2 months after first use | Used by native media-info parsing |
| Video snapshot | 6000 requests / 2 months after first use | Review this quota before using related video processing |
| Document HTML preview | No free quota | Not currently provided by AsterDrive |

Tencent Cloud pricing, free quotas, expiration rules, and region differences may change. Before production launch, check Tencent Cloud's latest COS / COS CI pricing pages and console prompts.

- [Tencent Cloud COS CI document processing pricing](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/460/58121)

## 9. Create a Test Policy Group

Do not directly modify the default policy group at the beginning. Create a test policy group first.

Open:

```text
Admin -> Policy Groups
```

Create a policy group, for example:

```text
COS Test Group
```

Add one rule:

| Field | Recommended value |
| --- | --- |
| Storage policy | The COS policy you just created |
| Priority | Keep the default or make it the first matched rule |
| File size range | Cover all sizes first for easier testing |

## 10. Bind a Test User or Team

### Bind a User

Open:

```text
Admin -> Users -> User Details
```

Change the test user's policy group to `COS Test Group`.

### Bind a Team

Open:

```text
Admin -> Teams -> Team Details
```

Change the test team's policy group to `COS Test Group`.

Team-space uploads use the team policy group, not the personal user's policy group.

## 11. Run Real Validation

Use a test account to run through:

- Upload a small file
- Upload a large file
- Download a file
- Preview an image
- If native thumbnails are enabled, upload a matching image suffix and check the thumbnail task
- If native media info is enabled, upload a matching audio/video suffix and check the file-info panel
- Delete a file
- Restore from trash
- Share a file and download it

During validation, also check:

- Whether background tasks succeed
- Whether objects are written under the expected COS prefix
- Whether the browser console reports CORS errors
- Whether AsterDrive logs show COS 403 / 404 / signing errors
- Whether the Tencent Cloud console shows expected CI calls or cost statistics

## 12. Move Production Traffic

After the test policy group is verified, move real users or teams to the target policy group.

If you need to migrate existing files, do not directly change the old policy's bucket, endpoint, or prefix. The correct flow is:

1. Create a new COS policy
2. Test connection and real uploads/downloads
3. Create a migration task through `Admin -> Storage Policies -> Migrate Data`
4. Adjust policy group rules after migration completes

:::caution[Do not directly change real destinations for policies that already have files]
Bucket, endpoint, and prefix determine where old files are located. If you change them directly, old files may no longer be found.
