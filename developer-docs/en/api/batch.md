# Batch Operations

The following paths are relative to `/api/v1` and require authentication.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/batch/delete` | Batch-delete files and folders |
| `POST` | `/batch/move` | Batch-move files and folders |
| `POST` | `/batch/copy` | Batch-copy files and folders |
| `POST` | `/batch/archive-compress` | Create an archive-compress background task |
| `POST` | `/batch/archive-download` | Create a batch ZIP download ticket |
| `GET` | `/batch/archive-download/{token}` | Stream a ZIP by ticket |

## Request body

Selection-style request bodies use mixed resource selection:

```json
{
  "file_ids": [1, 2],
  "folder_ids": [10, 11]
}
```

- `file_ids` and `folder_ids` can both be present
- the total item count per request is capped at 1000
- each item is processed independently; one failure does not roll back the rest

## Response shape

- `POST /batch/delete`
- `POST /batch/move`
- `POST /batch/copy`

return a `BatchResult` structure with:

- `succeeded`
- `failed`
- `errors`

The frontend uses this to drive batch progress and grouped toast messages.

- `POST /batch/archive-compress` returns `TaskInfo`
- `POST /batch/archive-download` returns `StreamTicketInfo`

## `POST /batch/delete`

Behavior:

- files and folders use the same soft-delete logic as the single-item endpoints
- results are counted per item
- one failure does not stop the rest of the batch

## `POST /batch/move`

Request body also includes the target folder:

```json
{
  "file_ids": [1, 2],
  "folder_ids": [10],
  "target_folder_id": 99
}
```

Behavior:

- files and folders can be moved together to the same destination
- `target_folder_id = null` means move to root
- drag-move and batch-move reuse the same capability

## `POST /batch/copy`

Request body:

```json
{
  "file_ids": [1],
  "folder_ids": [10],
  "target_folder_id": 99
}
```

Behavior:

- file copy does not physically duplicate the blob; it only increments the reference count
- folder copy recursively copies the subtree
- name conflicts at the destination are resolved automatically, just like single-item copy

## Archive download and archive compress

### `POST /batch/archive-compress`

Creates an `archive_compress` background task that packages the selected files / folders into a ZIP and writes the result back into the current workspace.

Request body:

```json
{
  "file_ids": [1, 2],
  "folder_ids": [10],
  "archive_name": "workspace-export",
  "target_folder_id": 99
}
```

Semantics:

- if `target_folder_id = null`, the server first checks whether the selected items all come from the same parent directory; if they do, the ZIP is written back there, otherwise it goes to the root
- the endpoint returns `TaskInfo`, not a file stream
- the result later appears in the background-task API
- the team-space variant is mounted under `/teams/{team_id}/batch/archive-compress`

### `POST /batch/archive-download`

Request body:

```json
{
  "file_ids": [1, 2],
  "folder_ids": [10],
  "archive_name": "workspace-export"
}
```

Success returns a short-lived stream ticket:

```json
{
  "code": "success",
  "msg": "",
  "data": {
    "token": "st_xxxxx",
    "download_path": "/api/v1/batch/archive-download/st_xxxxx",
    "expires_at": "2026-04-12T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Key points:

- `archive_name` is optional; the final file always ends in `.zip`
- the ticket expires after 5 minutes by default
- `download_path` may be relative or absolute depending on `public_site_url`
- the ticket is bound to the current user and workspace, so it cannot be reused elsewhere
- this path is a short-lived ticket plus direct streaming ZIP download, not a background-task record

### `GET /batch/archive-download/{token}`

The `download_path` from the previous call returns the raw `application/zip` stream.

Implementation notes:

- empty folders are preserved
- multiple selected folders are packed according to the current tree shape
- duplicate top-level names inside the ZIP are automatically disambiguated
- only active items that are visible to the current workspace are included
