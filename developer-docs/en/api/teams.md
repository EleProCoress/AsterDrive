# Teams and Team Spaces

The following paths are relative to `/api/v1` and require authentication.

Team capabilities have two layers:

- team management: team profile, members, and audit logs
- team workspace: files, folders, uploads, search, tags, shares, WebDAV accounts, trash, and tasks

## Team management

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/teams` | List teams visible to the current user |
| `POST` | `/teams` | Create a team |
| `GET` | `/teams/{id}` | Read team details |
| `PATCH` | `/teams/{id}` | Update team name or description |
| `DELETE` | `/teams/{id}` | Archive a team |
| `POST` | `/teams/{id}/restore` | Restore an archived team |
| `GET` | `/teams/{id}/audit-logs` | Read team audit logs |
| `GET` | `/teams/{id}/members` | Paginated team members |
| `POST` | `/teams/{id}/members` | Add a team member |
| `PATCH` | `/teams/{id}/members/{member_user_id}` | Change member role |
| `DELETE` | `/teams/{id}/members/{member_user_id}` | Remove a member |

Current behavior:

- `GET /teams` supports `archived=true`
- `POST /teams` is still system-admin only and sets the caller as team `owner`
- admins can create a team for someone else through `/admin/teams`; that entry adds the target user with `admin` role
- `DELETE /teams/{id}` archives rather than physically deletes; cleanup happens after `team_archive_retention_days`
- `GET /teams/{id}/audit-logs` requires team `owner` or `admin` and supports filters such as `user_id`, `action`, `after`, `before`, `limit`, `offset`
- `GET /teams/{id}/members` supports `keyword`, `role`, `status`, `limit`, `offset`, `sort_by`, `sort_order`
- `POST /teams/{id}/members` accepts either `user_id` or `identifier`, exactly one of them; omitted `role` defaults to `member`
- member pagination returns `owner_count` and `manager_count` in addition to `items` / `total` / `limit` / `offset`

## Team workspace

Team workspace APIs are rooted at:

```text
/api/v1/teams/{team_id}
```

They are not a separate "team filesystem" implementation. They reuse the personal-space file / folder / upload / search / tag / share / trash / task / WebDAV-account semantics under a team scope.

These reuse personal-space contracts. See [Batch](./batch.md), [Search](./search.md), [Tags](./tags.md), [Sharing](./shares.md), [Trash](./trash.md), [Tasks](./tasks.md), [WebDAV](./webdav.md), and [WOPI](./wopi.md).

Team-specific notes:

- public REST access for team shares still uses `/api/v1/s/{token}`, and the frontend page is still `/s/:token`
- file writes prefer folder-level `policy_id`; without folder override, the effective storage policy is resolved through `teams.policy_group_id`
- team WOPI startup uses `/teams/{team_id}/files/{id}/wopi/open`, but callbacks still go to `/api/v1/wopi/files/{id}` because team scope lives in the access token
- team archive-download tickets can only be consumed under the matching team route
- recoverable team upload sessions return the same shape as personal sessions but are scoped to the team
- `frontend_client_id` works for team upload init and recoverable-session filtering
- `POST /teams/{team_id}/tasks/offline-download` creates an `offline_download` task that imports an HTTP/HTTPS URL into the team space; its request body matches personal `/tasks/offline-download`
- team WebDAV accounts authenticate through the same WebDAV mount entry, but their storage scope is the team; ordinary members can manage only accounts they created, while team `owner` / `admin` users can manage all accounts in the team
- archive extraction and compression create background tasks rather than blocking synchronously
- `target_folder_id = null` defaults to source-folder or common-parent behavior just like personal space
